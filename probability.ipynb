    "1. **Sample space** $\\Omega$, which is set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.\n",
    "2. **Probability law**, which assigns to a set $A$ of possible outcomes (also called an **event**) a nonnegative number $P(A)$ (called **probability** of $A$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability law must satisfy the following properties:\n",
    "1. (**Nonnegativity**) $P(A) \\geq 1$.\n",
    "2. (**Additivity**) If $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$ is a sequence of disjoint event, then the probability of their union satisfies: $P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup A_n) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \\ldots + P(A_n)$.\n",
    "3. (**Normalization**) $P(\\Omega) = 1$.\n",

    "## Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability provides us with a way to reason about outcome of an experiment, based on **partial information**. Conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is denoted as $P(A|B)$. By definition:\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n",
