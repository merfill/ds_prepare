    "1. **Sample space** $\\Omega$, which is set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.\n",
    "2. **Probability law**, which assigns to a set $A$ of possible outcomes (also called an **event**) a nonnegative number $P(A)$ (called **probability** of $A$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability law must satisfy the following properties:\n",
    "1. (**Nonnegativity**) $P(A) \\geq 1$.\n",
    "2. (**Additivity**) If $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$ is a sequence of disjoint event, then the probability of their union satisfies: $P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup A_n) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \\ldots + P(A_n)$.\n",

    "Random variable is a real valued function of the experimental outcome. Conceptually, randome variable is needed to assign numeric values to outcomes to be easy to define probability of outcomes.\n",

    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of heads in a sequence of 5 coin tosses is randome variable.\n",
    "* Sum of rolls in involving two rolls of die is randome variable as well as number of sixes in two rolls.\n",

    "\n",
    "Discrete random variable is a real-valued function of experiment outcomes that can take a finite or infinite countable number of values.\n",

    "Discrete random variable has an associated **mass function** (**PMF**), which gives the probability of each numerical value that the random variable can take.\n",

    "Let $X$ is discrete random variable and $x$ is any possible value of $X$. **Probability mass** of $x$ denoted $p_X(x)$, is the probability of event $\\{ X = x \\}$ consiting of all outcomes that give rise of to a value of $X$ equal to $x$:\n",

    "A coin tosses $n$ times with probability $p$ to come up as head and $1-p$ to come up as tail. Let $X$ be a number of heads in $n$-toss sequence. We refer to $X$ as a **binomial** random variable with parameters $n$ and $p$.\n",
